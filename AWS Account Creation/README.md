## Introduction

## Project Goals

## What is Cloud

cloud (or cloud computing) refers to the delivery of computing services—like servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more—over the internet (“the cloud”) instead of using local servers or personal computers.

## What is AWS Cloud 

There are many cloud providers like Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and IBM Cloud, each offering a range of service for businesses and individuals.
Amazon Web Service (AWS) is one of the leading cloud providers in the market, providing a comprehensive suite of cloud computing services.

It offers a vest array of computing resources, including servers, storage, databases, networking, and more, all delivered over the internet. It's like a huge digital world where companies and people can use really strong computers without having to invest in physical hardware.

## Importance of AWS Cloud 

The AWS Cloud is important because it lets businesses and individuals do things that were once only possible for big companies with lots of money.

Now, even small businesses and startups can access the same powerful tools and technology to build. grow, and scale their ideas.

Example - If you're starting a new business, and you need a computer, some memory (RAM), storage space (like a hard disk), and a fast processor (CPU) to run your new app. But here's the ticky part: you're not sure if your business will take off, if lots of people will use your app, or it'll just be a small project.

Instead of buying all those resources, upfront, which could cost a ton of money, you can think of AWS like a big rental store for digital stuff. You only take what you need right now, and you pay for it as you use it. So if your app suddenly gets really popular and needs more resources, you can eaily get them from AWS without breaking the bank. And if things slow down, you can scale back and pay less because it works on **Pay As You Go Model.**
