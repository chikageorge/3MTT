# üõ†Ô∏è Mini Project ‚Äì Working with Functions in Shell Scripting

## üìå Project Goal

You‚Äôre developing a shell script for one of **DataWise Solutions‚Äô** clients. The script automates the setup of **EC2 instances** and **S3 buckets**, and you'll be focusing on **using functions** to organize and streamline your code.

---

## üß© Why Use Functions?

Functions help you:

- **Organize code logically**
- Improve **readability and maintenance**
- Allow **reusability** of logic

Each requirement should be encapsulated into a function. Here are the tasks you will cover with functions:

---

## ‚úÖ Functional Requirements

1. Check if the script has an argument
2. Check if AWS CLI is installed
3. Check if AWS authentication environment variable is set

---

## üìò Function Syntax in Shell

```bash
function_name() {
  # function body
  # logic and commands here
}
```

---

## üîç 1. Function to Check if Script Has an Argument

### üîì Without a Function
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Checking the number of arguments
if [ "$#" -ne 1 ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <environment>"
  exit 1
fi

# Accessing the first argument
ENVIRONMENT=$1

# Acting based on the argument value
if [ "$ENVIRONMENT" == "local" ]; then
  echo "Running script for Local Environment..."
elif [ "$ENVIRONMENT" == "testing" ]; then
  echo "Running script for Testing Environment..."
elif [ "$ENVIRONMENT" == "production" ]; then
  echo "Running script for Production Environment..."
else
  echo "Invalid environment specified. Please use 'local', 'testing', or 'production'."
  exit 2
fi
```

### üîê With a Function
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Environment variable
ENVIRONMENT=$1

# Function to check arguments
check_num_of_args() {
  if [ "$#" -ne 1 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <environment>"
    exit 1
  fi
}

# Function to handle environment logic
activate_infra_environment() {
  if [ "$ENVIRONMENT" == "local" ]; then
    echo "Running script for Local Environment..."
  elif [ "$ENVIRONMENT" == "testing" ]; then
    echo "Running script for Testing Environment..."
  elif [ "$ENVIRONMENT" == "production" ]; then
    echo "Running script for Production Environment..."
  else
    echo "Invalid environment specified. Please use 'local', 'testing', or 'production'."
    exit 2
  fi
}

# Calling functions
check_num_of_args "$@"
activate_infra_environment
```

---

## üîç 2. Function to Check if AWS CLI is Installed

```bash
# Function to check if AWS CLI is installed
check_aws_cli() {
  if ! command -v aws &> /dev/null; then
    echo "AWS CLI is not installed. Please install it before proceeding."
    return 1
  fi
}
```

### üß† Explanation

- `command -v aws`: checks if `aws` command is available.
- `!` negates the result, meaning ‚Äúif aws is **not** found‚Ä¶‚Äù
- `&> /dev/null`: suppresses output (both stdout and stderr).
- `return 1`: indicates an error.

You can also test this on your machine using:

```bash
which aws
```

---

## üîç 3. Function to Check If AWS Profile Is Set

```bash
# Function to check if AWS profile environment variable is set
check_aws_profile() {
  if [ -z "$AWS_PROFILE" ]; then
    echo "AWS profile environment variable is not set."
    return 1
  fi
}
```

### üß† Explanation

- `-z "$AWS_PROFILE"` checks if the variable is empty.
- If true, it prints an error and returns 1.

---

## üìÅ AWS Credentials Overview

Run `aws configure` to set these up.

### `~/.aws/credentials`

```ini
[default]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY

[profile testing]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_TESTING_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_TESTING_SECRET_KEY

[profile production]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_PROD_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_PROD_SECRET_KEY
```

### `~/.aws/config`

```ini
[default]
region = us-east-1
output = json

[profile testing]
region = us-west-2
output = json

[profile production]
region = us-west-2
output = json
```

Set the AWS profile using:

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=testing
```

---

## üîö Final Shell Script with All Functions

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Environment variable
ENVIRONMENT=$1

# Function to check number of arguments
check_num_of_args() {
  if [ "$#" -ne 1 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <environment>"
    exit 1
  fi
}

# Function to check if AWS CLI is installed
check_aws_cli() {
  if ! command -v aws &> /dev/null; then
    echo "AWS CLI is not installed. Please install it before proceeding."
    return 1
  fi
}

# Function to check if AWS profile is set
check_aws_profile() {
  if [ -z "$AWS_PROFILE" ]; then
    echo "AWS profile environment variable is not set."
    return 1
  fi
}

# Function to activate environment-specific logic
activate_infra_environment() {
  if [ "$ENVIRONMENT" == "local" ]; then
    echo "Running script for Local Environment..."
  elif [ "$ENVIRONMENT" == "testing" ]; then
    echo "Running script for Testing Environment..."
  elif [ "$ENVIRONMENT" == "production" ]; then
    echo "Running script for Production Environment..."
  else
    echo "Invalid environment specified. Please use 'local', 'testing', or 'production'."
    exit 2
  fi
}

# Call functions
check_num_of_args "$@"
check_aws_cli
check_aws_profile
activate_infra_environment
```

## üéâ Summary

These are I learned:

‚úÖ Organize shell scripts using functions  
‚úÖ Validate input arguments  
‚úÖ Check for CLI tools and environment variables  
‚úÖ Apply logic based on dynamic input  

This modular approach will help me in real-world automation projects where clean, reusable, and testable code is key.
